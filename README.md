# Introduction


# Requirements

Hyperf has some requirements for the system environment, it can only run under Linux and Mac environment, but due to the development of Docker virtualization technology, Docker for Windows can also be used as the running environment under Windows.

The various versions of Dockerfile have been prepared for you in the [hyperf/hyperf-docker](https://github.com/hyperf/hyperf-docker) project, or directly based on the already built [hyperf/hyperf](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperf/hyperf) Image to run.

When you don't want to use Docker as the basis for your running environment, you need to make sure that your operating environment meets the following requirements:  

 - PHP >= 8.2
 - Any of the following network engines
   - Swoole PHP extension >= 4.5，with `swoole.use_shortname` set to `Off` in your `php.ini`
   - Swow PHP extension (Beta)
 - JSON PHP extension
 - Pcntl PHP extension
 - OpenSSL PHP extension （If you need to use the HTTPS）
 - PDO PHP extension （If you need to use the MySQL Client）
 - Redis PHP extension （If you need to use the Redis Client）
 - Protobuf PHP extension （If you need to use the gRPC Server or Client）
